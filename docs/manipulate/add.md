// b -> the manipulation result
```

Units are case insensitive, and support plural and short forms. Note, short forms are case sensitive.

Alternatively, you can use [durations](../durations/durations) to add to Day.js object.

```js
result = dayjs().add(dayjs.duration({'days' : 1}))
```

When decimal values are passed for **days** and **weeks**, they are rounded to the nearest integer before adding.
