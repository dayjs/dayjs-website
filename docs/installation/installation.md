Day.js is designed to work seamlessly in both browser and Node.js environments. All code should function in both, and unit tests are executed in both environments.

Currently, the following browsers are used for the CI system: Chrome on Windows XP, IE 8, 9, and 10 on Windows 7, IE 11 on Windows 10, the latest Firefox on Linux, and the latest Safari on macOS 10.8 and 10.11.

To try the sample code, simply open your browser's console and enter the code.
