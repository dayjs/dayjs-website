`Locale#relativeTime` should be an object of the replacement strings for `dayjs#from`.

@>UpdateLocale

```js
dayjs.extend(updateLocale)

dayjs.updateLocale('en', {
  relativeTime: {
    future: "in %s",
    past: "%s ago",
    s: 'a few seconds',
    m: "a minute",
    mm: "%d minutes",
    h: "an hour",
    hh: "%d hours",
    d: "a day",
    dd: "%d days",
    M: "a month",
    MM: "%d months",
    y: "a year",
    yy: "%d years"
  }
})
```

`Locale#relativeTime.future` refers to the prefix/suffix for future dates. `Locale#relativeTime.past` refers to the prefix/suffix for past dates. 

For all others, a single character refers to the singular, and a double character refers to the plural.

#### Additional token processing

If a locale requires additional processing for a token, it can set the token as a function with the following signature instead of a string. The function should return a string.

```js
relativeTime: {
  ...,
  yy: function (number, withoutSuffix, key, isFuture) {
    return string;
  }
}
```

The `number` argument refers to the number of units for that key. For `m`, the number is the number of minutes, etc.

The `withoutSuffix` argument will be true if the token will be displayed without a suffix, and false if it will be displayed with a suffix. (The reason for the inverted logic is because the default behavior is to display with the suffix.)

The `key` argument refers to the replacement key in the `Locale#relativeTime` object. (eg. `s m mm h`, etc.)

The `isFuture` argument will be true if it is going to use the future suffix/prefix and false if it is going to use the past prefix/suffix.

#### Relative Time thresholds and rounding

You can pass a config object while using this plugin to update its thresholds and rounding config.

```js
var config = {
  thresholds: [{}],
  rounding: function
}
dayjs.extend(relativeTime, config)
```

`thresholds` is an `Array` of `Object` defined when a unit is considered a minute, an hour and so on. For example, by default more than 45 seconds is considered a minute, more than 22 hours is considered a day and so on. To change those you can pass a new `thresholds` like this.

```js
// strict thresholds
var thresholds = [
  { l: 's', r: 1 },
  { l: 'm', r: 1 },
  { l: 'mm', r: 59, d: 'minute' },
  { l: 'h', r: 1 },
  { l: 'hh', r: 23, d: 'hour' },
  { l: 'd', r: 1 },
  { l: 'dd', r: 29, d: 'day' },
  { l: 'M', r: 1 },
  { l: 'MM', r: 11, d: 'month' },
  { l: 'y' },
  { l: 'yy', d: 'year' }
]
```

You can also add your own thresholds key and update locale accordingly.

```js
var thresholds = [
  ...,
  { l: 'ss', r: 59, d: 'second' }
]
dayjs.updateLocale('en', {
  relativeTime: {
    ...,
    ss: "%d seconds"
  }
})
```

`rounding` is an `Function` to process the number before supplying it to the relativeTime format string specified in the locale. To change those you can pass a new `rounding` like this.

```js 
// Math.round by default
var rounding = Math.floor
```
